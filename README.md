# EV Fleet Charging Intelligence

Workplace charging, from the plug event to a feasible schedule: mirror the sessions, audit them, then forecast and dispatch.

Day 1 delivers the mirror, the audit gate, and CI. Forecast, scheduler, simulation, and the API are stubs that exit 0.

## Day 1

```bash
make install
make data      # Kaggle mirror (no token) + audit gate
make test
```

`ACN_DATA_TOKEN` switches the download to the Caltech API. Without it, the pipeline uses the public Kaggle mirror and recovers sessions from the truncated JSON instead of crashing.

Provenance on every generated artifact: `git_sha`, `config_hash`, `data_hash`, `utc_now`.

Tariff prices in `configs/` are placeholders. Do not quote a cost until those TODOs are replaced with the tariff sheet.
